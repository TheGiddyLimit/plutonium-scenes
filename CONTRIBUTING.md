## Adding Maps

- Import a scene using Plutonium's Map Importer. ⚠ This should be the "DM" version of the scene, where possible, as "player" scene data is auto-generated from a linked DM scene. ⚠ 
- Add/edit walls
- Export the scene (Right-click -> `Export Data` in Foundry)
- `npm run convert -- --file "path/to/fvtt-Scene-*.json" --type [adventure|book]`
